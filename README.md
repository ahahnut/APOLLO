# APOLLO: Differential Private Online Multi-Sensor Data Prediction
In this project, we use our proposed differential privacy mechanism in our research paper. and we use the multi-sensor data prediction model in [ACM MM 2020](https://2020.acmmm.org) paper [MISA: Modality-Invariant and -Specific Representations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03545.pdf)

### Data Download

- Install [CMU Multimodal SDK](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK). Ensure, you can perform ```from mmsdk import mmdatasdk```.    
- Download [pre-computed splits](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IBwWNH0XjPnZWaAlP1U2tIJH6Rb3noMI?usp=sharing) and place the contents inside ```datasets``` folder.     

### Running the code

1. ```cd src```
2. Set ```word_emb_path``` in ```config.py``` to [glove file](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip).
3. Set ```sdk_dir``` to the path of CMU-MultimodalSDK.
2. ```python train.py --data mosi```. Replace ```mosi``` with ```mosei``` for mosei dataset.
